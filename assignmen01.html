        I have little experience and a very basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and javascript. 
        I have had a few projects where I worked in html and css and created pages but it has 
        been a while since then so I will need quite the refresher.

        In this class, I hope to learn more about advanced web development techniques, including responsive design, JavaScript frameworks, and server-side technologies. 
        I also want to gain a deeper understanding of web accessibility and user experience design. 
        Ultimately, I aim to become a proficient web developer and create impactful web projects.
